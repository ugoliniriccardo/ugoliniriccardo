Studying software planning and a huge passion for the architecture of information has led me to become a Magespecialist Skeeler where I was able to develop my skills and interest in Magento 2. Thanks to this background and the following experience in Websolute, as well as never-ending individual studying, I was able to exponentially increase the quality of my code and get to the point of planning new architectures and innovative paths for excellent e-commerce, to the point of reaching such a level that allowed me to take the most important test in Magento 2: the Adobe Certified Master – Adobe Commerce Architect.

Together with Danilo Argentiero, I founded Ghost Unicorns, a reality which sees us working side by side on a selection of the best projects and clients who are looking for a simply perfect e-commerce, capable of overcoming any obstacle. We only take on stimulating projects which recognize the value of our skills, with a budget of over EUR 100,000.
